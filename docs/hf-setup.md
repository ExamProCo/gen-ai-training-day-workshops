# What are we using Hugging Face for?

We will be using Hugging Face to download model weights.
We will be using Hugging Face libraries such as `transformers`, `tgi` and `optimum-intel`.

- In order to download model weights we need a Hugging Face API Key.
- Also some models require you to accept an agreement on their Hugging Face repo and some models take several minutes to hours or days to be approved.

To ensure you can participate in these workshops be sure to create a Hugging Face in advanced.
